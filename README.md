## Overview

Nextcloud Hub is a fully open-source on-premises content collaboration platform. Teams access, share and edit their documents, chat and participate in video calls and manage their mail and calendar and projects across mobile, desktop and web interfaces.

### YunoHost-specific features

In addition to Nextcloud core features, the following are made available with
this package:

 * Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
 * Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
 * Allow multiple instances of this application
 * Optionally access the user home folder from Nextcloud files (set at the installation, the sharing is enabled by default)
 * Serve `/.well-known` paths for CalDAV and CardDAV on the domain only if it's not already served - i.e. by Baïkal


**Shipped version:** 27.1.2~ynh2

**Demo:** https://demo.nextcloud.com/

## Disclaimers / important information

### Configure ONLYOFFICE integration

#### With Nextcloud App (no ARM support, lower performance)

Starting from Nextcloud 18, it features a direct integration of ONLYOFFICE (an online rich text document editor) through a Nextcloud app.
To install and configure it:
- Install *Community Document Server* application in your Nextcloud. That's the part that runs ONLYOFFICE server.
- Install *ONLYOFFICE* application. That's the client part that will connect to an ONLYOFFICE server.
- Then in Settings -> ONLYOFFICE (`https://yourdomain.tld/nextcloud/settings/admin/onlyoffice`), if you want to configure which file formats should be opened by ONLYOFFICE.
- Here you go :) You should be able to create new type of documents and open them.

*NB: ONLYOFFICE Nextcloud App is only available for x86 architecture - for **ARM** architecture (Raspberry Pi, OLinuXino...), consider the YunoHost App below*

#### With YunoHost App (ARM64 support, better performance)

For better performance and ARM64 support, install ONLYOFFICE YunoHost App and connect it to Nextcloud, see the tutorial in the [doc of onlyoffice_ynh package](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/onlyoffice_ynh/blob/master/README_fr.md#configuration-de-onlyoffice-server)

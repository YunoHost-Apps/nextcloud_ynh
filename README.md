## Limitations

To integrate the logout button to the SSO, we have to patch Nextcloud sources.
In waiting an upstream integration, the source code integrity checking has been
disabled to prevent the warning message.

Also, note we made the choice to disable third-parties applications at the
upgrade. It allows to prevent an unstable - and sometimes broken - Nextcloud
installation. You will just have to manually activate them after the upgrade.

Finally, the following error message in Nextcloud logs can be safely ignored:
```
Following symlinks is not allowed ('/home/yunohost.multimedia/user/Share' -> '/home/yunohost.multimedia/share/' not inside '/home/yunohost.multimedia/user/')
```

## Additionnal informations

#### Migrate from ownCloud

**This is not considered as stable yet, please do it with care and only for
testing!**

This package handle the migration from ownCloud to Nextcloud. For that, your
ownCloud application must be **up-to-date** in YunoHost.

You will then have to upgrade your ownCloud application with this repository.
This can only be done from the command-line interface - e.g. through SSH. Once
you're connected, you simply have to execute the following:

```bash
sudo yunohost app upgrade -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/nextcloud_ynh owncloud --verbose
```

The `--verbose` option will let you see the full output. If you encounter any
issue, please paste it.

Note that a cron job will be executed at some time after the end of this
command. You must wait that before doing any other application operations!
You should see that Nextcloud is installed after that.

Note that it does not change the application label nor the URL. To rename
the label, you can execute the following - replace `Nextcloud` with whatever
you want:

```bash
sudo yunohost app setting nextcloud label -v "Nextcloud"
sudo yunohost app ssowatconf
```
